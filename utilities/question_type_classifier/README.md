# Question Type Classifier

A utility to automatically classify medical coding questions by type (CPT, ICD, HCPCS, or other) and append this information to the JSON file.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd utilities/question_type_classifier
python question_classifier.py
```

## How It Works

The classifier uses regex patterns to identify key terms in questions:

1. **CPT Questions** - Contain terms like "CPT", "CPT code", "which CPT"
2. **ICD Questions** - Contain terms like "ICD", "ICD-10", "ICD-10-CM", "ICD code"  
3. **HCPCS Questions** - Contain terms like "HCPCS", "HCPCS Level II", "HCPCS code"
4. **Other Questions** - Don't contain any of the above terms (anatomy, medical terminology, etc.)

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Regex-based classification** using comprehensive pattern matching
- ‚úÖ **Case-insensitive matching** to catch variations in capitalization
- ‚úÖ **Preserves existing data** - only adds `question_type` field
- ‚úÖ **Statistics reporting** - shows count of each question type
- ‚úÖ **Example display** - shows sample questions for verification
- ‚úÖ **Dry-run mode** - preview results without saving changes

## Usage

### Basic Classification
```bash
# Classify questions in the default file
python question_classifier.py
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Specify a different JSON file
python question_classifier.py --input /path/to/questions.json

# Show more examples of each type (default: 3)
python question_classifier.py --examples 5

# Preview classification without saving changes
python question_classifier.py --dry-run
```

## Output Format

The script adds a `question_type` field to each question:

```json
{
  "question_number": 1,
  "question": "Which CPT code covers the excision of an oral lesion?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "40800",
    "B": "41105",
    "C": "41113", 
    "D": "40804"
  },
  "question_type": "CPT"
}
```

## Classification Patterns

### CPT Patterns
- `\bcpt\b` - Matches "CPT" as a whole word
- `\bcpt\s+code\b` - Matches "CPT code"
- `\bwhich\s+cpt\b` - Matches "which CPT"
- `\bcpt\s+coding\b` - Matches "CPT coding"

### ICD Patterns  
- `\bicd\b` - Matches "ICD" as a whole word
- `\bicd\s*-?\s*10\b` - Matches "ICD-10" or "ICD 10"
- `\bicd\s*-?\s*10\s*-?\s*cm\b` - Matches "ICD-10-CM"
- `\bwhich\s+icd\b` - Matches "which ICD"
- `\bicd\s+code\b` - Matches "ICD code"

### HCPCS Patterns
- `\bhcpcs\b` - Matches "HCPCS" as a whole word
- `\bhcpcs\s+level\s+ii\b` - Matches "HCPCS Level II"
- `\bwhich\s+hcpcs\b` - Matches "which HCPCS"
- `\bhcpcs\s+code\b` - Matches "HCPCS code"
