The other codes are for more complex procedures: 10030 (image-guided fluid collection drainage), 10040 (acne surgery, e.g., scarification, pore abrasion), and 10120 (incision and removal of foreign body, subcutaneous tissues). Milia removal is often considered a simple extraction, and in the absence of a more specific code for milia, 10000 series codes for integumentary system procedures are generally considered. Given the options, 10021 is the most appropriate for a simple, non-biopsy removal of a superficial lesion like milia, as it represents a minor procedure on the integumentary system.\\\",\\\"choice\\\":\\\"A\\\"}\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 353,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 210,\n    \"total_tokens\": 563\n  }\n}",
