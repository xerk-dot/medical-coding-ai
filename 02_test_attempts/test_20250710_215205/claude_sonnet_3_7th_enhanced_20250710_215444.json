This code specifically covers \"incision and drainage of soft tissue abscess, superficial\" which accurately describes the procedure performed on James. The axillary region (armpit) is considered a superficial location for coding purposes. The other codes are incorrect: 20002 is for deep abscesses, 20060 is for incision and drainage of an abscess with a foreign body, and 20005 is for deep abscesses in specific complex locations.
