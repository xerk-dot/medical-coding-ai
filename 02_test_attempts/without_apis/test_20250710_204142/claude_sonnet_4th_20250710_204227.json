However, looking at the voting pattern and reconsidering, wart removal is typically coded as destruction of benign lesions. The most appropriate code for wart excision would be 17110 (destruction of benign lesions other than skin tags or cutaneous vascular proliferative lesions, up to 14 lesions). Among the given choices, 10120 covers removal of subcutaneous lesions which could include wart excision, making it the best available option from these specific choices.",
